    <h1>Notes for week 5: Testing and Debugging</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>It's an error that produce a return value that can be used by the program to deal with the error.
            An exception will also produce a <strong>stack trace</strong>.
            A sequence of funtions or methods that lead to the point where the error ocurred.
        </p>
        <pre>
        <code>
            function three(){ unicorn(); }
            function two(){ three(); }
            function one(){ two(); }
            one();

            << index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
            at three (index.html:13)
            at two (index.html:17)
            at one (index.html:21)
            at index.html:24`
            
        </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
        <p> The strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.
            Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file:</p>
        <pre><code>
            'use strict'
        </code>
    </pre>
        <p>Placing 'use strict' at the beginning of a file will enforce strict mode on all the JavaScript in the file.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Debugging in the browser</h2>
        <h3>Alert</h3>
        <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code.
        </p>
        <h3>Console</h3>
        <p><strong>console.log():</strong>
            This can be used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program, although it will not
            actually stop the execution of the program in the same way as alert() does.
        </p>
        <p><strong>console.trace(): </strong>
            This will show the functions that were called in the lead up to an exception occurring while the code is
            running.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Debugger tools</h2>
        <p><strong>debugger:</strong>
            This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see
            where the program is currently up to.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Test-driven Development</h2>
        <p>
            It is the process of writing tests before any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail,
            because there is no code to test. The code is continually tested at each stage to make sure it continues to
            work.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <strong> TDD workflow</strong>
            <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
            <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
